To become a member of this society, one must have a score of 98 percent on an intelligence scale.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isla McNav&#8217;s father, Jason, told Guinness World Records that by the age of 7 months, she could identify pictures by looking at books. At the age of 1, he begins to learn color names, numbers and the alphabet.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Isla&#8217;s second birthday, her aunt gave her an erasable tablet. Sekha Jason wrote the word &#8216;Red&#8217; in English one day. To everyone&#8217;s surprise, Isla was able to spell and read the word.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the names of different colors are written. Isla read them aloud without hesitation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Isla was enrolled in Mensa by her parents to keep her child&#8217;s talent alive. According to Jason, the biggest advantage of Mensa, an international non-profit organization, is that it is an organization of talent. Isla is now in preschool.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When a one-and-a-half-year-old child walks around, busy watching cartoons on his phone whenever he gets the chance, it is surprising that a child of the same age can speak and see the English alphabet quickly.
